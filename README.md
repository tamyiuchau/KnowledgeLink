# Minimalist guide to Python
Python is one of the most beautifully designed language.
Simple and Clear and Obvious. It is my first programming language,
and I managed to learn it in a weekend (though not some obscure part, ie multiple inherience).
This tutorial aims to further shorten the time to matter of hours,
by remove unnecessary materials in documentations, primer, stackoverflow answers and blogs,
keeping the noise to signal ratio as low as possible,
while covering every edge case possible.

Not every module included in python distribution (aka Standard Library)
will be discussed
Best practice and rational behind will not be discussed.
(Maybe write about this latter)

#Why minimalism?
1)I consider minimalism as implied by Occam's razor, which means it should more accurate represent what it is.
2)Generally, less instructions means the program will run faster.
3)It is less likely to make bugs as your mind doesn't have to keep tract of lots of expressions, and for those expression you need to keep track on, you clearly know why they exsist and what they behave.
